//npm init
//npm i express 
    Express - a framework used for building web applications ontop of Node 
//create index.js 
//create express application by using express() function 
    var express = require('express');
    var app = express(); 
//Specify your routes / route handlers using HTTP requests (req, res) 
    //The req object represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on. The object is always referred to as req (and the HTTP response is res) but its actual name is determined by the parameters to the callback function in which you're working. 
//create Middleware
    //Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. 
    //The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.
//Use environment variable PORT to listen to the app using process.env.PORT
    //const port = process.env.PORT || 3000; 
    app.listen(port, () => { console.log('Listening on port ${port}')});
//Use HTTP Get/Post requests to get movie genres/create new genres using Postman
    //returned objects from these requests must be parsed and returned back to the client when altered with new id (ex. {"name": "comedy"} should return {"id":6, name: "comedy"} when you use the get request to display /api/genres)
//npm i joi to validate the input that the client puts in 
    //joi allows you to create blueprints or schemas for JavaScript objects to ensure validation of key information 
    //joi returns proper error messages to the client
